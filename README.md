# getBlocklists
## Combines all freely available blocklists from iblocklist.com into one and inputs them into Transmission on Mac OSX

I originally grabed this from some Github repository, but don't remember which one. It has been modifyed to some extent (i don't remember how much) and is actually only intended for my personal use. 
But as I stumbeled opon it cleaning out my desktop, I thought it would be fair to share back, just in case anyone is interested in useing it.

## Features:
- Grabs all free blocklist on iblocklist.com
- Combines them into one file
- removes obvious duplicates (*very rough, only with uniq*)
- Installs it to Transmission Config

*It's not tested at all, but this thing sould posibly be runnable on linux too.*
